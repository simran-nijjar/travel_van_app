# travel_van_app
Travel Van Application built using React JS, Node JS, Express JS and MySQL. REST APIs tested using XAMPP and Postman applications. Created as a group assignment for my CMPT 354 Database Systems I class with Dr. Hazra Imran. I obtained permission from Dr. Imran to post this assignment publicly on GitHub.

## My Contribution:
- I worked on the front-end of this application by using React to create pages and navigate between pages. 
- I created many SQL queries that would allow user to create, update, and delete their account. 
- I created the front-end and SQL queries that would allow the user to look for categories and filter them for a few categories within various pages.

## How to Run the Application:
1. download or clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/simran-nijjar/travel_van_app.git
2. run on terminal or git bash: node ./front_end/src/db/index.js
3. run in front_end folder: npm i 
4. run: npm start
